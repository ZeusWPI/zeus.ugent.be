We are Zeus WPI. We like games. We like programming. So we decided to build our very own programming game. Now, we would like to share. Welcome to **Badass Battle Bots**. The objective of the game is to write a computer program that will take on other competitors' programs in a grand battle for honour, glory and world domination. Sounds exciting? You bet it is! We are working hard to create a game that is exciting yet very simple, so that anyone with minimal coding skills can participate. So, what can you expect? There will be a series of codenights where we kindly invite you to exchange strategies with your peers, get some assistance when you are stuck, trash-talk your opponents, or compete in a preliminary tournament to show your strength. We will top this off with a grand tournament, where you will see the action unfold before your eyes. There will be prizes.

The rules for this game will be disclosed on **Tuesday March 1st**. On this day, we will organise an introductory session starting at **18h in computer room Hopper (campus De Sterre, building S5)**. Be sure to stop by, we'd love to help you get started.

On this same date we will announce the date of the final tournament. You can count on a few weeks to code your bot.

For those unable to attend, all information will be made available on [zeus.ugent.be/battlebots](https://zeus.ugent.be/battlebots).
