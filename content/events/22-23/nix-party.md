Nix is 20 years old this year and that's cause for celebration. Determinate
Systems calls everyone with an interest or love for Nix to come together and
enjoy some pizza at a [nix.party](https://www.nix.party/).

The concept is simple: get some people together to talk about Nix and eat pizza.

Given that there are quite a few Nix/NixOS ~~evangelists~~ users in Zeus, we 
are taking Determinate Systems up on this offer. Anyone interested in Nix is 
free to join for pizza.

Don't know anything about Nix? Join anyway, there will definitely be people 
willing to introduce you to the lord and saviour of build systems and Linux 
distributions.
