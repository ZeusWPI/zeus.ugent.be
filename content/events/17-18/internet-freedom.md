# Our Freedom At Stake

In the last year, Net Neutrality has been a hot topic in the news.
America is creating a law that would allow ISP's to make your connection to any service (e.g. Netflix) slower, unless you pay an extra fee.

Regulations like this are not only happening across the Atlantic sea, but also in our own continent. The European Union is finally reforming our copyright laws and some laws that won't do any good for your freedom. Like sharing articles on Facebook and Twitter? With the reform, this could become a crime... Come to the talks and we will explain you why and we will tell you how we can stop it.

## The speakers

### [Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu/en/) (European Parliament)
