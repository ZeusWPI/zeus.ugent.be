This event is part of the [TeCH TalkZ](<%= @items['/blog/17-18/tech-talkz.md'].path %>), a collaboration between the two student associations Zeus WPI and CenEka.

# Intro

[delaware](https://www.delaware.pro/en-be), the global consultancy firm with which we co-hosted the [Lasershoot](<%= @items['/blog/17-18/lasershoot-blogpost.md'].path %>) event is back. This time they will do a two-part presentation about technology and innovation at delaware. The total presenting time will be 1h30, divided among both topics. Afterwards we'd like to invite you, as per usual at talks, to a brief reception.

# Part 1: Continuous web app deployment with zero downtime

Did you know that it takes Google, Microsoft and Facebook only a few days or weeks to release a new version of their applications?
During this session we'll discuss how we can use Scrum as a process to enforce continuous delivery, 
and what it takes to deploy new stable versions of web applications with confidence (and without any downtime).
This part will be presented by Emanuel Dejonghe, senior full-stack developer for delaware and Ghent University alumnus.

# Part 2: AI / ML @delaware

... Description will arrive soon ...

This part will be presented by Wouter Labeeuw, solution lead data science at delaware and KULeuven alumnus.

Hope to see you there
