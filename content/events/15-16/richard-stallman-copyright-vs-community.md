Zeus WPI is very proud to host a talk by Richard Stallman. On the **17th of November**, he will give a non-technical talk about copyright and how it fits in our modern computer based society, . Richard Stallman is one of the most important people in the world of computer science and free software, and has received 15 honorary doctorates and professorships for his work.

"Copyright developed in the age of the printing press, and was designed to fit with the system of centralized copying imposed by the printing press. But the copyright system does not fit well with computer networks, and only punishment can enforce it.

The global corporations that profit from copyright are lobbying to increase their copyright powers, while suppressing public access to technology. But if we seriously hope to serve the only legitimate purpose of copyright - to promote progress, for the benefit of the public - then we must make changes in the other direction."
