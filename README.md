This repository contains the source code for [zeus.ugent.be](https://zeus.ugent.be), the website of Zeus WPI, the official student association of Informatics at Ghent University. The site is developed using [nanoc](https://github.com/nanoc/nanoc), which is actively developed by ex-Zeus member [ddfreyne](https://github.com/ddfreyne). The CSS framework used is [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). We primarily focus on using markdown for blogposts and events. Feel free to make a Pull Request with a blog post if you feel inspired and need an outlet!

Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/ZeusWPI/zeus.ugent.be/wiki) for questions about structure.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Ruby (gem) and Node.js (npm). Installation instructions are listed below.

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Installing

If bundler is not yet installed on your system, make sure to install it using the following command:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

In the root directory of the project, execute following commands

```bash
bundle install
npm install
```

You will (momentarily) also need `pandoc` and `latex` to compile the reports from the board meetings. Refer to your OS package manager to install these things.

These will pull in all Ruby and Node.js dependencies. If everything goes well, you should be able to execute the following.

```bash
bundle exec nanoc live
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000> to view the site! When developing, the site gets regenerated when editing files. A simple refresh will show the new changes.

### Deploying

The latest builds on master get deployed automatically using [travis](https://travis-ci.org).

For manual deployment, run

```bash
bundle exec nanoc deploy --target public
```

If you want to deploy this on your own system for whatever reason, just serve the files using a webserver like nginx or Apache.

## Built With


* [nanoc](https://github.com/nanoc/nanoc), static site generator
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), CSS framework
